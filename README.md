# shellStone

**shellStone** is a lightweight shell-like project It's not just a set of utilities — it's a growing experiment in building foundational tools from scratch, with simplicity and full control in mind.

## ✨ Why shellStone?

In a world of bloated systems and complex shells, *shellStone* is an attempt to go back to the basics. No unnecessary features, no hidden abstractions — just direct, clean, understandable code.

This repository started with just a few essential tools, implemented manually, one by one. The philosophy is: **build what you need, understand what you build**.

More tools will be added over time, each crafted carefully to do one thing well.

## 🧠 Philosophy

- Minimalism over convenience
- Code you can read and trust
- No dependencies beyond the compiler and POSIX
- Education through construction

## 🛠 Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mateo-rfz/shellStone.git
cd shellStone
make

Each tool is compiled into a standalone binary.
📦 Usage

All binaries are independent. You can run them like:

./toolname [args...]

They are meant to behave as Unix-style CLI tools — clean input/output, no noise.
🚧 Work in Progress

This project is still at an early stage. Many parts will evolve. Expect:

    More tools

    Smarter CLI behaviors

    Internal refactoring for clarity and extensibility
